PyGauges is a pygame frontend to convert data live from an OBD-II port to digital gauges.
==
My stupid car has a single gauge that goes up when it ragebaits me with how little information my dashboard gives me.
I wanted to solve the issue of not seeing the information I want to (temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, etc)
by creating my own way to view this data.

This project is only for practice as I haven't truly had a project to do in a while. I will likely polish and un-spaghettify this code as time goes on. Ideally I would write this in julia for practice but I'm already familliar with pygame. 

TLDR: i suck at coding sry :)
