<h2>PyGauges is a pygame frontend to convert data live from an OBD-II port to digital gauges.</h2>
<p>
My stupid car has a single gauge that goes up when it ragebaits me with how little information my dashboard gives me.
I wanted to solve the issue of not seeing the information I want to (temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, etc)
by creating my own way to view this data.
